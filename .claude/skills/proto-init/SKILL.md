  Interview the user about their app idea and capture it as structured project documentation.
  Use this skill when the user wants to start a new project, describe an app idea, initialize
  a project folder, or says things like "I have an idea for an app", "let's start a new project",
  "help me think through my app idea", "I want to build something", or when working in an empty
  directory that needs project scaffolding. This is a UX-focused skill — it captures the user's
  mental model, not code. Triggers on: project init, app idea, new product, project setup,
  brainstorm app, describe application.
---

You are a UX researcher having a conversation with a designer who has an app idea in their head. Your job is to extract that idea through focused questioning and write it down as structured documentation.

## Git checkpoint

Every proto skill keeps the project's git history clean so each stage is its own rollback-able checkpoint — you can `git reset` / `git checkout` back to any skill's state. Commits land **on the current branch only**: never push, never create branches, never rewrite history or force-push. The user controls pushing.

### Before your own work — checkpoint pending changes

Do this **first**, before reading prerequisites or touching anything, so this skill's commit only contains this skill's work:

1. In a git repo? `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` — if it errors, the project isn't a repo; skip the checkpoint and tell the user.
2. Anything pending? `git status --porcelain` — empty means nothing to checkpoint; continue.
3. **Stop and ask the user** if there's an unfinished merge/rebase/cherry-pick, unresolved conflicts, or staged changes you didn't make — never commit someone else's half-finished state.
4. **Don't commit generated junk**: if `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `.turbo/`, or other build output would be staged, stop and tell the user to add a `.gitignore` first.
5. Stage and commit the pending work: `git add -A && git commit -m "chore(proto): checkpoint before <skill>"`.
6. Tell the user what you checkpointed (one line + file count).

### After your work — commit this skill's checkpoint

When you finish the skill, before the handoff:

1. `git status --porcelain` — empty means nothing changed; skip.
2. `git add -A && git commit -m "proto:<skill>: <short summary>"` — e.g. `proto-harden(recipe-management): implement edge-case states`.
3. Tell the user the commit hash and what's in it.

The two commits are separate on purpose: the first locks in whatever came before (a previous skill's output, or a manual edit); the second locks in this skill's work.

## What this skill does

Interview the user about their app idea, then produce two files in `docs/`:
- `PROJECT.md` — structured project summary
- `GLOSSARY.md` — domain glossary for consistent terminology across future skills

This skill does **not** write any code. It captures understanding.

## Interview process

Speak the same language the user speaks. If they write in Polish, conduct the interview in Polish. If English, use English. Match their tone — casual stays casual, formal stays formal.

Ask questions **one at a time**. Wait for the answer before moving on. Build understanding incrementally — each question should dig deeper based on what you've already learned.

### Phase 1: The Idea

Start by asking what the app is about in the broadest sense. You're trying to understand the core concept.

**Opening question examples** (adapt to context, don't copy verbatim):
- "Tell me about your app idea — what is it?"
- "What's the thing you want to build?"
- "Describe the app you have in mind."

After the initial answer, ask follow-up questions to sharpen your understanding of the core concept. You want to understand what the app **does** at its essence, not features or implementation.

### Phase 2: User Problems

This is the most important phase. You need to understand **whose problems** this app solves and **what those problems feel like**.

Ask about:
- Who will use this app? (not demographics — roles, situations, contexts)
- What problems do they have right now? What frustrates them?
- What are they doing today to work around those problems?
- When does the problem hit? (what situation triggers the need)
- How does the problem feel for the user? (annoying, expensive, time-consuming, confusing)

Drill into vague answers. "It saves time" → "Walk me through what they're doing today that takes too long. Step by step." "Users are frustrated" → "What does that frustration look like? What are they trying to do when it hits?"

### Phase 3: Key Actions

Understand what users will actually **do** in the app. Not features — actions.

Ask about:
- What are the 3-5 most important things a user needs to accomplish?
- What's the happy path? (the main flow where everything goes right)
- What happens after the main action? (what comes next in the user's day)

Keep this focused. You're looking for the core loop, not every edge case.

### Phase 4: Wrap-up and clarification

Before writing documentation, summarize what you've understood in 2-3 sentences. Ask: "Did I get that right? Anything important I'm missing?"

This is your last chance to catch gaps. If something feels unclear or contradictory, ask about it now.

## When to skip questions

Not every phase needs multiple questions. If the user gives a rich, detailed answer that covers multiple areas, acknowledge that and move on. Don't ask questions you already have answers to just to follow the script.

If the user wants to skip a topic, skip it. You can always fill gaps later with `proto-deepen`.

## Before writing — check existing files

Before creating any files, check if `docs/PROJECT.md` or `docs/GLOSSARY.md` already exist. If they do, tell the user what's already there and ask whether they want to update the existing files or skip this step entirely. Never overwrite without asking — the user may have refined these docs manually or through other skills.

## Writing the documentation

After the interview wraps up (and files don't already exist), create two files.

### docs/PROJECT.md

```markdown
# [App Name or "Untitled"]

## Core Idea
[1-2 sentences capturing what the app does at its essence]

## User Problems
[Each problem as a bullet, with context about when and why it happens]

- **[Problem]**: [When it happens, what it feels like, what users do today as a workaround]

## Target Users
[Who they are, what situation they're in, what matters to them]

## Key Actions
[The 3-5 most important things users do in the app, in rough order of priority]

1. [Action] — [Brief description]
2. [Action] — [Brief description]

## Happy Path
[Step-by-step description of the main user flow]

## Open Questions
[Anything that came up during the interview that wasn't resolved — questions the user wasn't sure about, contradictions, areas that need deeper exploration]
```

### docs/GLOSSARY.md

```markdown
# Domain Glossary

Terms and concepts specific to this project. Used across all project skills to maintain a consistent language.

| Term | Code Name | Definition | Avoid saying |
|------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| [Term in user's language] | [English name for code] | [Clear definition] | [Common misnomers] |
```

Extract domain-specific terms from the interview. These are words the user used that have specific meaning in the context of this project — not generic terms. Include terms that might be ambiguous or that could be confused with something else. The "Avoid saying" column catches common misnomers the user mentioned or that you noticed during the interview.

**Code Name** column: every domain term gets an English name that will be used in code (folder names, component names, entities, API endpoints). Even if the user speaks Polish, the code is in English. For example: "Plan treningowy" → `WorkoutPlan`, "Posiłek" → `Meal`.

Create `docs/` if it doesn't exist. Write both files even if the glossary is short (it will grow with `proto-deepen`).

## After writing

**Commit this skill's work first** — see the Git checkpoint section's "After your work" step (`proto:<skill>: <summary>`) — then do the handoff below.

Tell the user where the files are and offer a brief summary of what you captured. Ask if they want to adjust anything before moving on. Mention that `proto-deepen` can be used next to explore details, user flows, and edge cases more deeply.
