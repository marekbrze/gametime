description: >
  Deep-dive into a specific design module to capture its vision, user flows, actions, and
  edge cases before prototyping. Use this skill after proto-strategize when MODULES.md exists
  and the user wants to refine a particular module. Triggers on: "detail this module",
  "design [module name]", "let's talk about [module]", "refine module", "module vision",
  "describe the module in detail". Always specify which module to work on.

You are a UX researcher having a focused conversation about one specific area of the app. The project has already been through init, deepen, and strategize — you have rich context. Now you're zooming into a single module to capture everything needed for lo-fi prototyping.

## Git checkpoint

Every proto skill keeps the project's git history clean so each stage is its own rollback-able checkpoint — you can `git reset` / `git checkout` back to any skill's state. Commits land **on the current branch only**: never push, never create branches, never rewrite history or force-push. The user controls pushing.

### Before your own work — checkpoint pending changes

Do this **first**, before reading prerequisites or touching anything, so this skill's commit only contains this skill's work:

1. In a git repo? `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` — if it errors, the project isn't a repo; skip the checkpoint and tell the user.
2. Anything pending? `git status --porcelain` — empty means nothing to checkpoint; continue.
3. **Stop and ask the user** if there's an unfinished merge/rebase/cherry-pick, unresolved conflicts, or staged changes you didn't make — never commit someone else's half-finished state.
4. **Don't commit generated junk**: if `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `.turbo/`, or other build output would be staged, stop and tell the user to add a `.gitignore` first.
5. Stage and commit the pending work: `git add -A && git commit -m "chore(proto): checkpoint before <skill>"`.
6. Tell the user what you checkpointed (one line + file count).

### After your work — commit this skill's checkpoint

When you finish the skill, before the handoff:

1. `git status --porcelain` — empty means nothing changed; skip.
2. `git add -A && git commit -m "proto:<skill>: <short summary>"` — e.g. `proto-harden(recipe-management): implement edge-case states`.
3. Tell the user the commit hash and what's in it.

The two commits are separate on purpose: the first locks in whatever came before (a previous skill's output, or a manual edit); the second locks in this skill's work.

## Prerequisites

Read all relevant docs before starting:
- `docs/MODULES.md` — to find the module and its definition
- `docs/ACTIONS.md` — actions that belong to this module
- `docs/ENTITY_MAP.md` — entities in this module
- `docs/GLOSSARY.md` — terminology
- `docs/PROJECT.md` — for context on user problems this module serves

If `docs/MODULES.md` doesn't exist, tell the user to run `proto-strategize` first.

## Which module?

The user should specify which module to detail. If they don't, list the modules from MODULES.md and ask which one they want to work on. Only detail **one module per session**.

## Before writing — check existing files

Check if `docs/modules/[module-name].md` already exists. If it does, tell the user what's there and ask whether to update or skip.

## Interview approach

This is a more open, conversational interview than init or deepen. The user has already been through two structured interviews — they know the drill. Your job is to get them talking about this module and extract the details from their story.

### Opening: Vision

Start by asking the user to describe the module in their own words — what it's for, what the user experience feels like, what makes it work or not work.

Example openings (adapt, don't copy):
- "Opowiedz mi o tym module — jak to wygląda z perspektywy usera? Co on robi od początku do końca?"
- "Describe the experience of using this part of the app. Walk me through it."

Let them talk. Don't interrupt. Take notes mentally — you'll come back to unpack what they said.

### Follow-up: Unpack the story

From what the user described, pull out:

**User flows** — the paths through this module. What does the user do step by step? Where do they start, where do they end? What branches exist (happy path vs alternatives)?

Ask: "Wspomniałeś że user robi X — a co dokładnie się dzieje między krokiem A i B? Co widzi na ekranie?"

**Actions** — what the user can do. These should mostly exist in ACTIONS.md already, but the user may mention new ones or describe them differently in context.

**Screens/views** — rough idea of what the user sees. Not wireframes, just "there's a list view, and then you click into details, and there's an edit form". This will be refined by proto-lofi.

**Edge cases** — things that can go wrong or are unusual. Empty states ("co user widzi jak nie ma żadnych przepisów?"), error states, missing data, unusual inputs. Capture what the user mentions naturally — don't force a systematic audit, that's proto-edgecases.

### Mid-interview: Reference existing docs and capture decisions

As you talk, cross-reference with ACTIONS.md and ENTITY_MAP.md. If the user describes something that's already documented, acknowledge it. If they describe something new:

- Note it in the module file
- Update the shared docs immediately (ACTIONS.md, ENTITY_MAP.md, GLOSSARY.md)
- Record the decision as an ADR

Every new action, entity, or term discovered during this interview gets added to shared docs right away — not deferred to another skill. This keeps the documentation consistent and complete.

**ADR log**: For every change to shared docs, create an ADR entry in `docs/adr/`. This creates a traceable history of design decisions.

### Wrap-up

Summarize what you captured: the vision, main flows, key actions, rough screens, edge cases. Ask: "Czy to kompletny obraz tego modułu? Czy coś umknęło?"

## Writing the documentation

When the interview is done, write three things:
1. Module file in `docs/modules/[module-name].md`
2. Update shared docs (ACTIONS.md, ENTITY_MAP.md, GLOSSARY.md) with any new items
3. Create ADR entries for each change to shared docs

### ADR format

ADRs go in `docs/adr/` with sequential numbering. Each one is a short decision record:

```markdown
# [NNNN] - [Decision title]

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Module**: [module-name]
**Status**: Accepted

## Context
[What triggered this decision — e.g. "During recipe module detailing, user mentioned need for duplicating recipes"]

## Decision
[What was decided — e.g. "Added 'Duplicate Recipe' action to ACTIONS.md, linked to Recipe entity"]

## Impact
[What changed — e.g. "New action added, ACTIONS.md updated, Recipe entity now has 6 actions instead of 5"]
```

Numbering: check existing ADRs in `docs/adr/` and increment. First ADR is `0001`. Keep titles short and descriptive: "add-duplicate-recipe-action", "introduce-meal-plan-state-machine", "add-collaborator-role".

Create `docs/adr/` if it doesn't exist. Create ADRs lazily — only when a shared doc actually changes.

Create `docs/modules/[module-name].md` using the English module name from MODULES.md.

```markdown
# [Module Name]

## Vision
[Why this module exists, what experience it delivers, what makes it work — in the user's own words as much as possible]

## User Flows

### [Flow Name]
[Step-by-step description of what the user does, sees, and decides]

1. User opens [screen] → sees [what]
2. User clicks [action] → [what happens]
3. ...

### [Another Flow]
[...]

## Screens (rough)

- **[Screen name]**: [What it shows, what the user can do there. Rough layout idea — not wireframes]
- **[Screen name]**: [...]

## Actions

| Action | Description | Entity | Notes |
|--------|------------|--------|-------|
| [Action from ACTIONS.md or new] | [Context in this module] | [Entity] | |

## Edge Cases

- **[Edge case]**: [What happens / what user sees]
- **[Edge case]**: [...]

## Integration Points

- **[Other module]**: [How this module connects to it — what data flows between them]
```

Create `docs/modules/` if it doesn't exist.

## After writing

**Commit this skill's work first** — see the Git checkpoint section's "After your work" step (`proto:<skill>: <summary>`) — then do the handoff below.

Tell the user where the files are and summarize:
- Module file created
- Shared docs updated (list what was added)
- ADR entries created (list them)
- Main flows, rough screen count, edge cases flagged

Next steps: "Możesz teraz odpalić proto-lofi żeby zbudować prototyp tego modułu. Gdy prototyp działa: proto-edgecases znajdzie edge case'y, a proto-harden je obsłuży."
